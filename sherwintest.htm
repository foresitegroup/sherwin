<strong>REVISION DATE: 02/6/14</strong><br>
<br>

It is the intent of these specifications on all points, whether or not covered herein, to supply a runway closure marker to indicate to inbound aircraft that the marked runway is closed.<br>
<br>

<ol type="A" style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold;">
    <li>
        DESCRIPTION:
        <ol>
            <li>The PORTABLE RUNWAY CLOSURE MARKER (RCM) must be designed to form a lighted X which contains twenty-one (21) 83WPAR38HIR.  It consists of light sources that transmit an aviation white color per SAE-AS25050.  It provides a minimum day effective intensity of 70,000 candela (cd) at the beam center, 34,000 cd at 10 degrees radius, and 13,000 cd at 15 degrees radius.  The minimum night effective intensity must be 2,000 cd at beam center, 970 cd at 10 degrees radius and 370 cd at 15 degrees radius. 25 degree weather proof outdoor standard base clear NFL25 (narrow flood lamp) with one (1) bulb located in the center and five (5) bulbs located in each of the four (4) legs. All X panel bulbs, light sockets, wiring and connections must be enclosed in a weather resistant housing.<br><br></li>
            <li>The lighted X formed when opened and operating will be 20' 6&quot; (6.248m) each continuous leg and 14' 6&quot; (4.420m) on the peripheral.<br><br></li>
            <li>The (RCM) must collapse for transport and storage so that all parts are inside the trailer frame dimensions to prevent damage.<br><br></li>
            <li>Illumination of the (RCM) will be in flashing mode. This must be controlled by a SOLID STATE FLASHER. <u>MECHANICAL FLASHERS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE</u>.<br><br></li>
            <li>A photo cell must be used to reduce the voltage to 60 volts for nighttime operations.<br><br></li>
            <li>
                Flash interval time will be:
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>Bright Mode - Approximately 2.5 seconds on and 2.5 secondsd off.</li>
                    <li>Dim Mode - Approximately 2.5 seconds on and 2.5 seconds off.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>The (RCM) must have at least two (2) lights mounted at the back.  One light is mounted on the upper portion of the X. This light indicates power is being supplied to the (RCM) and it is operating in the flash mode.<br><br></li>
            <li>A 360 degree solar powered safety light will be mounted on the Runway Closure Marker in such a way as to be visible by the tower or airport personnel if for any reason the generator should stop functioning. The light will be capable of flashing both day and night and have sufficient power to last for more than 140 hours.<br><br></li>
            <li>The (RCM) must be designed so it can be used while still attached to the tow vehicle or have the means to stand alone.<br><br></li>
            <li>The (RCM) must be able to withstand winds of 40 MPH (64.37 KPH) while in operational mode. <u>THIS MUST BE DOCUMENTED</u>.<br><br></li>
            <li>The runway closure marker must be discernible from a distance of 3 to 5 miles (4.828 to 8.047 km) VFR daytime and a minimum of 6 miles (9.656 km) VFR nighttime. These distances must be determined from an aircraft using a GPS. Documents substantiating these tests shall be provided by an independent third party.<br><br></li>
            <li>Set up time for the (RCM) must be accomplished by one person in five (5) minutes or less. This means the (RCM) can be raised and operating within this time frame.<br><br></li>
            <li>The (RCM) must have the fuel capacity to run at <u>FULL LOAD</u> for a <span class="redText">MINIMUM</span> of 120 hours without refueling.<br><br></li>
            <li>The (RCM) must have the capability of being 120V AC hard wired for the convenience of operating without the use of a generator for prime power.<br><br></li>
        </ol>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        LIGHTED X SUPPORT FRAME (Hydraulic Lift System):
        <ol>
            <li><span class="redText">IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY</span><span class="redText">,</span> the angle mechanism will be operated by an electro hydraulic lifting mechanism which will both raise and lower the X panel with power from 12 volt DC. The lifting mechanism is powered independent from the generator.  The X panel has an emergency up/down option located in hydraulic box in case of 120V failure (see addition B in Operators Manual). The actuator must be approved by the manufacturer for this application.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>The angle mechanism must be capable of tilting 3 degrees from vertical and have trailer adjustments to accommodate this angle no matter what the degree of the runway.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>The angle mechanism will be constructed of 2&quot; (60.96 cm) square tubing.<br /><br /></li>
